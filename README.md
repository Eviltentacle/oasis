# IOC Vetting Automation Tool

This project automates the process of scanning **IP addresses**, **URLs**, **domains**, and **Hashes** in **VirusTotal**, then logs the results into an Excel workbook (`.xlsx`). The tool is designed to avoid overwriting sheets and is ideal for analysts, threat hunters, and SOC teams.

## ðŸ“‚ Features

- âœ… Scans IPs, URLs/domains, and Hashes. #Email Address will be added soon
- âœ… Extracts IOCS and checks them via VirusTotal.
- âœ… Outputs results into a designated Excel sheet (e.g., `IP`, `URL`, `Domain`, Hashes) without affecting other sheets.
- âœ… Multithreaded scanning for better performance.
- âœ… Avoid overwriting and creates output file if it exist.
- âœ… Supports resuming and updating existing workbooks.

###  v1.0 - Initial Release

**Features:**
- Hardcoded input file (`ioc_vetting.xlsx`)
- IP scan with VirusTotal API
- Output written into a fixed sheet in the Excel workbook

**Limitations:**
- No main menu or user interaction
- Country code from VirusTotal not converted to full country name
- URLs and domains with or without `http://`/`https://` not reliably parsed

**Fixes:**
- Generic output improved
- Separated result sheets (e.g., IP, URL) in the workbook instead of overwriting the entire file

**Known Issues:**
- Unrecognized domains/URLs depending on `http://` or `https://` prefix

---

###  v2.0 - Menu & Geoblock Support

**Features:**
- Added interactive main menu for selecting scan type (IP, URL, etc.)
- Added support for geoblocked country lookup
- Improved URL parsing:
  - Automatically handles domains with/without `http://`/`https://`
  - Converts country codes to full country names

**Fixes:**
- Country name conversion issue
- Domain recognition regardless of URL format

**Known Issues:**
- Does not yet detect SHA1/SHA256 hashes automatically

---

###  v3.0 - Performance & Hash Recognition

**Features:**
- Introduced multithreading for faster IOC scanning
- Automatically detects and categorizes SHA1/SHA256 hashes from input
- Intelligent formatting and writing of results into corresponding sheets

**Fixes:**
- Avoids overwriting unrelated sheets during parallel scans

---

### ðŸš§ Coming Soon: v4.0

**Planned Features:**
- Supports both hardcoded input (`ioc_vetting.xlsx`) and dynamic user-provided input via arguments
